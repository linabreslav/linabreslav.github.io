<h4>Before I moved to lovely Durham, North Carolina, I was a researcher at a social and economic policy organization where I honed my appreciation for rigorous research. Here is a small sample of my favorite work.</h4>

  <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/let-girls-be-girls"> Let Girls Be Girls </a><br>
  In neighborhoods where disadvantage and violence are great and collective efficacy and social control are low, a gender-specific neighborhood mechanism can emerge that has different effects on male and female youth. Some communities develop a pervasive coercive sexual environment (CSE) in which harassment, domestic violence, and sexual exploitation of women and even very young girls become part of everyday life. This research report describes the CSE phenomenon, as well as next steps for research and action.

  Since 2005, New York City has undertaken several initiatives to reduce the citys unintended teenage pregnancy rate, aiming to change the context of decisions to engage in sexual activity and to use contraception. These strategies included developmentally appropriate comprehensive sex education from middle school onward, the removal of barriers to access contraception, and reproductive health services that are youth friendlyparticularly male youth friendly. Rates of teenage pregnancy and sexual activity declined while these programs were under way. This brief is one in a series examining selected social service initiatives undertaken during the Bloomberg administration.

  <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/descriptive-study-county-versus-state-administered-temporary-assistance-needy-families-programs"> A Descriptive Study of County- versus State-Administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Programs</a><br>
  One-half of all families receiving TANF cash assistance live in states with county-administered TANF programs. But what does “county-administered” mean? States do not report details about how counties administer TANF, but these details and their differences from state-administered programs, have implications for federal policies, regulations, and technical assistance. This report closely examines the TANF programs in four states with county-administered systems (California, Colorado, Minnesota, and North Dakota) and provides detailed information on TANF administration in selected counties in these states. The report also identifies differences between county- and state-administered TANF programs and describes the technical assistance needs of county-administered programs.
