          As a UI designer with a strong research background,
          user experience is always at the top of my mind.
          My goal is to create fully responsive, smart interfaces
          that are clean and beautiful with unexpected touches
          that bring joy to the user. </p>

          When Iâ€™m not at my computer, you can usually find me
          searching for a decent bagel in Durham, slowly learning
          chords on the ukulele, and participating in cooking
          challenges. </p>
