          As a UI/UX designer and developer with a strong research background,
          user experience is always at the top of my mind.
          My goal is to create smart interfaces
          that are clean and beautiful with unexpected touches
          that bring joy to the user.

          In my past life, I was a researcher at a think tank in Washington, DC. I loved my work, but quickly realized I was spending too many billable hours deciding on colors for data visualizations that were supposed to be in grayscale. Armed with a pre-established love of code, I enrolled in the UI Design Bootcamp at the Iron Yard Raleigh and have been happily immersed in such things as code and color theory ever since.

          When Iâ€™m not at my computer, you can usually find me volunteering with Durham Women in Tech,
          searching for a decent bagel, slowly learning
          chords on the ukulele, and participating in cooking
          challenges.

          Are you a kindred spirit, someone with a question, or future colleague? I'd love to hear from you!</p>
