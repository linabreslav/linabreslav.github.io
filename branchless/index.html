After some short usability testing, I learned that users found the current site cluttered, outdated, confusing, and unpleasant to use. Bookshelf is a design-only project that emphasizes minimalism, inspiration, and highlights the beauty of a collection of book covers, taking inspiration from the books on your shelf.
