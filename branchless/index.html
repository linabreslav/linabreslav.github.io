          <h3>ABOUT + PROCESS</h3>
          This project was a user-flow design for a fictional online bank, so-called "Branchless" bank. After conducting a SWOT analysis, I went through a design brainstorming process. I chose to create a whimsical bank that bore little resemblance to one of the major, commonly known banks. I decided to design a fictinal bank that "laughs in the face of big banks" by prioritizing user goals. I chose to create a comical cactus logo and give it a south-western color palette to stand in stark contrast to the traditional colors of typical banks. <br><br>

          After sketching out the flow of the bank, I created wireframes using Sketch. After wireframes, I moved into the mock-up/prototype content phase, and, finally, the prototyping phase in Invision. I created a flow for a user to deposit a check via phone camera, apply the deposit to set precentages, and then review savings goals.

         <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
          My major challenge with the project was taking it from the photoshop stage to the invision stage. Once the screens were inside the prototyping tool, I noticed many changes I wanted to make.
