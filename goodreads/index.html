          <h3>ABOUT + PROCESS</h3>
          This project was a redesign of the current Goodreads.com logo, an assignment for The Iron Yard's UI Design Class. First, I conducted research on the full site in order to gain knowledge about functionality, purpose, history, and competitor landscape. I conducted a SWOT analysis in order to conceptualize the space Goodreads.com occupies for users. I then interviewed five users in order to identify patterns, focusing especially on the design of the logo and feel of the site in general. I used this research to create two personas that consolidated these patterns using Xtensio.<br><br>

           Through this process, I learned that users generally found the current site cluttered, outdated, confusing, and unpleasant to use. The users identified several positive aspects of the site design, including the clarity of the logo (though not the design otherwise), and the simplicity of colors. Several users mentioned that the logo was "uninspiring," and felt dated.Using this information, my personas, and a related word-brainstorm, I focused on designing a logo that was clear, modern, and inspiring. After a pen + paper sketching process, I designed a variety of logos using Illustrator. I received user feedback, iterated on these logos, and chose the final product based on adherance to the results of my research. I chose a full-screen and mobile logo to accomplish the same goals despite screen-size.

         <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
          My major challenge with the project was depicting "inspiration" while retaining a clean and minimalist aesthetic that would be at-home in a full re-design of the Goodreads.com website. I found that while I leaned toward color, the black-and-white design was most appropriate considering the results of my research.
