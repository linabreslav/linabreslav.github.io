      <h3>About</h3>
      This project was a redesign of the current Goodreads.com Bookshelf page for my TIY UI Design class. After some short usability testing, I learned that users found the current site cluttered, outdated, confusing, and unpleasant to use. <br> <br> The logo re-design was the first stage after the usability test. Because users had described the original logo of the offical site as "uninspiring", I opted to go for the theme of a lightbulb or a lamp representing knowledge and excitement. After a speed-brainstorm, I decided on the final logo image due to that fact that is has a bold, graphic contrast of black and white that pops while not detracting from the book covers; the most important piece of my redesigned site. <br> <br> After sketches and mockups, I developed the page and re-ran user tests. Users most-often described the new page as "pleasant to look at", and "easy to understand." Bookshelf is a design-only project that emphasizes minimalism, inspiration, and highlights the beauty of a collection of book covers, taking inspiration from the books on your shelf.`

     <h3>Challenges</h3>
      My major challenge with the project was combining a minimalist aesthetic with functionality while still ensuring that the site felt grounded. More complex designs, while fun to code, did not respect the results of the user research I had conducted.
