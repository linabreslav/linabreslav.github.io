    <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        This project was a redesign of the current Goodreads.com Bookshelf page for my TIY UI Design class. After some short usability testing, I learned that users found the current site cluttered, outdated, confusing, and unpleasant to use. Bookshelf is a design-only project that emphasizes minimalism, inspiration, and highlights the beauty of a collection of book covers, taking inspiration from the books on your shelf.`

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
     <p>
        My major challenge with the project was combining a minimalist aesthetic with functionality while still ensuring that the site felt grounded. More complex designs, while fun to code, did not respect the results of the user research I had conducted.
